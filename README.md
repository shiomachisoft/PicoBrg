[PicoLnCnv-WL]    
We will use a Raspberry Pi Pico W.  
PicoLnCnv-WL is firmware that performs the following line conversions(bridge) (a) and (b).  
(a) USB (virtual COM) <==> UART  
(b) Wi-Fi (TCP socket communication) <==> UART  
  
-When using Wi-Fi, Pi Pico W becomes a TCP server.  
-To use Wi-Fi, you will need a wireless LAN router that supports the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi standard "IEEE 802.11b/g/n."  
-The source code is not released.  
  
[PicoLnCnv]    
We will use a Raspberry Pi Pico.  
PicoLnCnv does not support Wi-Fi, unlike PicoLnCnv-WL.
