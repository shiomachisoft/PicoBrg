We will use a Raspberry Pi Pico W.  
PicoBrg is firmware that performs the following line conversions(bridge) (a) and (b).    
(a) Wi-Fi (TCP socket communication) <==> UART   
(b) USB (virtual COM) <==> UART  

-Use the PC app to configure UART and wireless LAN.  
-When using Wi-Fi, Pi Pico W becomes a TCP server.  
-To use Wi-Fi, you will need a wireless LAN router that supports the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi standard "IEEE 802.11b/g/n."  
-The source code is not released.
