*It was created using pico-sdk and C language without using MicroPython or Arduino IDE.  

We will use a Raspberry Pi Pico W.  
PicoBrg is firmware that performs the following line conversions(bridge) (a) and (b).    
(a) Wi-Fi (TCP socket communication) <==> UART   
(b) USB (virtual COM) <==> UART  

- When using Wi-Fi, Pi Pico W becomes a TCP server. 
- Use the PC app to configure UART and wireless LAN.   
- Please refer to the manual for instructions on how to use it.
